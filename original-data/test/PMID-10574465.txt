Human SOX11, an upregulated gene during the neural differentiation, has a long 3' untranslated region. To obtain essential genes for neuronal development, we have performed a molecular indexing method using a human teratocarcinoma cell line, NTera-2. We isolated a cDNA fragment, designated B18, as an upregulated gene during the neural differentiation. From the complete cDNA sequence of B18 it was revealed that this cDNA was the human SOX11 gene. While a previous report has determined only a approximately 2 kb of the SOX11 cDNA including the entire open reading frame, our full length cDNA was 8743 bp possessing a long 3' untranslated region. Human SOX11 cDNA was mapped to chromosome region 2p25.3 between markers AFMA070WC9 and WI-1412 by radiation hybrid mapping.
